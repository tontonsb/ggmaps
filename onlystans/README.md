# OnlyStans

Some places named -stan. Or something like that.

## Why?

Because OnlyStans is funny term I came across [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporncirclejerk/comments/1m6oski/comment/n4ld714/).

## Contents

20 locations per -stan. If a -stan has official coverage, that is what used.
If not, traversable (moving-able) coverage is preferred, but static locations are also included.
For some -stans like the Turkmen one there are only static locations, sry.

Contrary to the definition on reddit, I included some more stans stretching definition according to vibes.

- **Kazakhstan.** Official coverage.
- **Kyrgyzstan.** Official coverage.
- **Pakistan.** Spotty official coverage, few traversable spots and some static spots.
- **Uzbekistan.** Unofficial footage, both traversable and static spots.
- **Tajikistan.** Unofficial footage, static spots.
- **Turkmenistan.** Unofficial footage, static spots.
- **Afghanistan.** Unofficial footage, static spots.
- **Hayastan** (Armenia). Unofficial footage, mostly traversable.
- **Rajasthan** in Hindustan (India). It's a doublestan. Official coverage.
- **Bashkortostan** in Russia. Official coverage.
- **Tatarstan** in Russia. Official coverage.
- **Dagestan** in Russia. Official coverage.
- **Kashmir** (disputed by both **Pakistan** and **Hindustan**). Official coverage.
- **[Kurdistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan)** (overlaps Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq). Official footage in Turkey, traversable and static in Iran and Iraq, static in Syria.

I didn't want to include the whole Hindustan (India) as it's neither rare in official games, nor does it feel very stan-ish.
So this only includes the -stan Rajasthan and the part claimed by both Hindustan and Pakistan which also makes it a kind of doublestan.
