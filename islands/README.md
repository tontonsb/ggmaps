# Islands

A map to encounter to islands in.

## Why?

Many islands like Puerto Rico, Greenland, Bermuda or Guam are very distinctive and easy to recognize once you know them. But in regular games we encounter them so rarely it's easy to forget how they look like and even forget to consider them at all. And I'm saying that about Faroes and Canaries. But some like Principe, Falklands or Madagascar are so rare you can play a 100 games without seeing any of them. So here's a map to get a bit better chance of encountering them.

As the goal is to learn recognizing them and distinguishing them from other areas, this map also includes large and well known islands like Java and the Great Britain. So you can't just go "looks Scottish, must be the Orkneys in this map".

## Inclusion

An island is usually defined as a piece of land completely surrounded by water and smaller than Australia (they call those big ones "continents" for whatever reason).

For purposes of this map an "island" is defined as an island that has it's road/coverage network detached from the mainland, e.g. the "main" islands of Denmark are not included. And neither is Kalmar or the Prince Edward Island. Not much of an island if you can traverse the Street View until you reach Berlin, is it?

Besides we are not including river islands and lake islands, so don't bother to scan all of the inland Sweden.

However something very coastal might be included here as well as "sea islands" and the ones in straits. So St. Pierre and Miquelon, Martha's Vineyard, Gotland or Marmara are all game here.

Trying to include only official Street View coverage. Trekker footage is included. Boat footage is also included, but other footage is preferered when available.

## Game mode

This map is not optimized for a particular game mode. There's nothing specific to make moving, NM or NMPZ easier or to pose some specific hurdles or challenges in these modes. The intention was just to encounter these locations.

That being said, moving might be more appropriate if your goal is to get familiar with these locations.

## Distribution

I'm trying to balance

- Somewhat equal distribution (and a non-trivial chance of encounter) for all distinctive islands.
- Giving better insight (more locations) to larger islands with a variety of distinctive covered locations.
- Not overrepresenting same region (e.g. not having 50 Greek or Japanese islands) or each of the atolls in the British Indian Ocean Territory.

To strive for these goals, I'm using the following guidelines:

- Minimum 3 locations per standalone island (e.g. Deception Island, Bermuda or South Georgia) to ensure representation.
- Maximum 12 locations per island to prevent overrepresentation.
- Maximum 30 locations for mono-national archipelagos to prevent regional overrepresentation. This limits Balearic, Hawaiian or Faroe islands, but not the Caribbean ones.

For implementation of the distribution guidelines, multiple real islands count as a single "island" if they have continuous coverage, i.e. you can traverse from one to another in Street View. For example some groups of the Faroe islands or Orkney islands are counted as a single "island" entity here.
